# What is this?

I've written starter explanations just like this one many many times before. 

Is anything really different this time? Maybe not? Maybe, yes, fundamentally?

I have a studio website at mattfisherstudio.com and too many scattered social media and social media-like accounts. 

The way things have evolved slowly over time, I now think of my studio website as a kind of standing document for listing completed projects, and a place to put things that I want to be part of a CV. It changes slowly, and I don't think of it as a place to put things that are in progress.

Social media has been really tricky for me lately. 

One one hand it would be nice to have an informal place to share things that are in progress, and to share things that are not fully formed. And to talk to my friends and keep in touch. 

But on the other, there's something really, well, insidious about social media and about the drip of it. I haven't reconciled to that. I go back and forth about whether I think the problems I sense are part of one platform or other, or its just generational, or its somethinge else. 

So, this site is some kind of experment that sits in the middle. Not a document of completed projects, but still some kind of breadcrumb for where my head's at. Not a social media platform, but still some place to collect and share things. Sort of a blog, sort of a portfolio, sort of a sketchbook.

Some of what I'm putting here is my own digital work, some of it is pinned bookmarks, some of it is notes.
