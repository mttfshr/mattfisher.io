# Dev planning

* docs folders want to just have content in them and as much as possible move config to .vitepress 
* set up folder index behavior at root so index isn't needed
  * make a default for fodler view for any without custom layouts
  * assign custom layouts in root confif, maybe in config.mts
* can I move utility layouts like 404 to .vitepress?
