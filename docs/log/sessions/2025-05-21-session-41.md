# Session 41 Summary

- Finalized Cloudflare Images integration architecture and workflow
- Configured Synology NAS Web Station for static file serving:
  - Service: cloudflare_uploads using nginx
  - URL pattern: http://2751fruitvale.synology.me:8080/
  - Successfully tested image serving from NAS
- Clarified two distinct workflows:
  - **Workbook Items**: NAS â†’ Cloudflare (full integration with upload utility)
  - **Pins**: Keep current OG thumbnail approach (no Cloudflare needed)
- Defined complete upload utility architecture:
  - Directory-based processing: `npm run upload-media docs/workbook`
  - Recursive scanning of markdown files
  - NAS URL detection and Cloudflare upload
  - Direct markdown link replacement at runtime
  - Video thumbnail extraction from Vimeo frontmatter
  - Single catalog.json for tracking mappings
  - Batch processing with summary reporting and dry-run mode
- Ready to implement scripts/upload-media.js with all requirements defined
