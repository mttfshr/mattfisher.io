# Session 18 Summary

- Analyzed VitePress documentation regarding public assets directory
- Discovered discrepancy between VitePress standards and our configuration
- Found that VitePress documentation specifies `docs/public/` as the standard, while our configuration uses `docs/.vitepress/public/`
- Updated config.mts to move cache directory outside of docs/ for cleaner structure
- Created a plan to test which public directory location VitePress actually uses
- Developed approach to standardize on VitePress conventions for better maintainability
- Next steps: Create test script to verify asset serving from both locations and adjust accordingly
