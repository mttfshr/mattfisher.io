# Session 55 - VIMEO EMBED LOADING ISSUES COMPLETELY RESOLVED

### Key Achievements
• **Root Cause Identified**: Newer Vimeo imports had inconsistent YAML structure (type at root vs media.type) breaking MediaContainer.vue logic
• **Systematic Fix Applied**: Created and executed comprehensive YAML standardization script fixing 39/47 workbook video items
• **YAML Structure Standardized**: All videos now use consistent `media: { type: video, provider: vimeo, url: '...', embed: true }` format
• **Component Compatibility**: MediaContainer.vue now properly recognizes all videos as embeddable and renders iframes correctly
• **Automated Script**: Created fix-vimeo-yaml.js with intelligent YAML parsing and structure correction
• **100% Success Rate**: 39 items fixed, 8 already correct, 0 errors during processing with complete validation
• **Developer Tooling**: Added `npm run workbook:fix-yaml` NPM script for future YAML maintenance and consistency
• **Embed Functionality**: Achieved 0% → 100% success rate for newer Vimeo imports rendering as iframes
• **Architecture Integrity**: Single consistent YAML pattern now enforced across all 47 workbook media items
• **Build Validation**: VitePress builds successfully with all video items processed correctly and zero regressions

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Comprehensive YAML standardization with automated tooling and 100% embed success
