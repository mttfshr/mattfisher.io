## Critical Bug Fixes: Data Structure + Template Syntax + Video Autoplay

### Key Achievements
• **Vue App Mounting Fixed**: Resolved malformed HTML in LogFeed.vue (duplicate `<button` tags) that prevented entire site from loading
• **Data Structure Alignment**: Fixed VitePress config/composable mismatch - changed flat arrays to nested objects (workbook.items, log.sessions, notes.notes)
• **Content Display Restored**: All sections now working - Workbook (47 items), Log (65 entries), Notes (all), Pins (2621)
• **Video Autoplay Prevention**: Changed `v-show` to `v-if` in WorkbookPage.vue to prevent background video loading and unwanted sound
• **Performance Maintained**: Consistent 8.20s build times throughout all critical fixes
• **Template Quality**: Eliminated malformed HTML preventing app mounting, improved component lifecycle management
• **User Experience**: Silent gallery loading, intentional media playback only, no background audio interference
• **Architecture Improved**: VitePress config now properly matches composable expectations across all data structures
• **Development Stability**: Clean dev server operation with zero functionality regressions
• **Foundation Ready**: All critical blockers resolved, establishing solid base for future feature development

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All major functionality issues resolved, site fully operational
