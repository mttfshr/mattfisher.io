## Video System Modernization - 1:1 Aspect Ratio Fix

### Key Achievements
• **Letterboxing Issue Resolved**: Fixed 1:1 videos showing white bars despite correct aspect ratio calculations
• **Smart Video Detection**: Implemented JavaScript logic to classify videos as square (98-102%), portrait (>102%), or landscape (<98%)
• **Elegant CSS Solution**: Used `max-width: 100vh` for square videos, `max-width: 100vw` for widescreen (Matt's key insight)
• **Dynamic CSS Classes**: Added `video-square`, `video-landscape`, `video-portrait` for selective sizing constraints
• **Navigation Reactivity**: Vue watchers ensure aspect ratios update correctly during folio pagination
• **Vimeo API Integration**: Enhanced VimeoEmbed component to fetch exact video dimensions for classification
• **Zero Letterboxing**: Perfect square video display without distortion or white bars
• **Professional Presentation**: Clean video player with native controls and responsive design
• **Build Performance**: Consistent 7.6s builds with zero errors and no functionality regressions
• **Architecture Simplicity**: Avoided over-engineered solutions in favor of viewport-based constraints

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Phase 5 Video System Modernization with elegant aspect ratio handling
