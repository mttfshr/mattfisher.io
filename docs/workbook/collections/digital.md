# Digital Works

This collection brings together my works that primarily use digital tools and processes. Digital media is a core part of my practice, allowing for synthesis between traditional techniques and computational approaches.

The projects in this collection span various formats including video, interactive installations, software, and web-based works. They represent my ongoing exploration of digital tools as both medium and subject.
