# Video Synthesis Works

This collection showcases my video synthesis projects created using various analog and digital techniques. Video synthesis is a technique that uses electronic processing to generate and manipulate visual imagery without traditional cameras or pre-recorded footage.

## About Video Synthesis

Video synthesis is closely related to audio synthesis in that both use electronic processing to create content from scratch. Many of the techniques used in video synthesis were initially developed in analog video art from the 1960s and 1970s, but have been extended and hybridized with digital tools in contemporary practice.

My work in this area typically uses Max/MSP and custom video synthesis patches to generate visual material that responds to and reflects audio input or algorithmic processes.
