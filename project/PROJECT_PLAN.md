- **Mobile PWA Navigation**: Bottom navigation bar with thumb-friendly native app experience
- **Mobile-First Architecture**: Design for mobile first, enhance for desktop (architectural reversal)
- **Breaking Changes Accepted**: Prioritizing modern user experience over backwards compatibility

**Phase 1 - Foundation Changes (2-3 hours)**:
- **Remove Rail Navigation**: Clean removal of RailNav component and dependencies
- **Redesign AppBar**: Convert to breadcrumb-style navigation with page dropdown selectors
- **Create BottomNav**: PWA-style mobile navigation with native app patterns
- **Update GlobalLayout**: New responsive layout system without rail dependencies

**Phase 2 - Video System Modernization (2-3 hours)**:
- **Create VimeoEmbed Component**: Replace MediaContainer complexity (87% code reduction)
- **Dynamic Aspect Ratios**: Fix square video letterboxing by removing 16:9 hardcoding
- **Touch-Friendly Controls**: Larger, better-positioned mobile video buttons
- **Mobile Video Optimization**: Thumb-friendly interactions and native player integration

**Phase 3 - PWA Enhancement (2-3 hours)**:
- **Mobile-First CSS**: Complete rewrite of layout system starting from mobile
- **Touch Interactions**: 44px+ touch targets, swipe gestures, progressive enhancement
- **Performance Optimization**: PWA-style lazy loading and optimized asset delivery
- **Native App Feel**: Smooth animations, safe area handling, gesture recognition

**Key Benefits**:
- ✅ **Fixes Real UX Problem**: Eliminates clunky mobile experience identified in user testing
- ✅ **Modern App Experience**: PWA patterns provide native-like mobile interaction
- ✅ **Desktop Improvement**: Breadcrumb navigation more space-efficient than rail drawer
- ✅ **Video Issue Resolution**: Dynamic aspect ratios fix square video letterboxing
- ✅ **Future-Proof Architecture**: Mobile-first approach aligned with modern web standards

**Priority Level**: High - Addresses fundamental user experience problems with comprehensive solution
