# Workbook Gallery Implementation Plan

This document outlines the 4-phase implementation strategy for the workbook gallery system with chronological folio view and curated collections.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Design Principles
- **Primary Axis**: Chronological presentation (folio-style focused view)
- **Secondary Axis**: Tag-based discovery (curated collections + dynamic filtering)
- **Entry Point**: Latest work (`/workbook` → most recent)
- **Tag Structure**: Key:value pairs (`type:video`, `tech:video-synth`, etc.)
- **Collections**: Curated prominence with bookmarkable dynamic filtering

### Navigation Flow
```
Workbook Folio ↔ Collection Grid ↔ Individual Work
      ↓              ↓                    ↓
Chronological    Tag-based          Presentation
 browsing        discovery            mode
```

## Phase 1: Chronological Workbook Folio (2-3 sessions)

### 1.1 Core Folio Component
**Goal**: Create focused presentation with chronological navigation

**Components**:
- **`WorkbookFolio.vue`** - Main component with focused presentation
- **`WorkbookNavigation.vue`** - Clean prev/next with date context
- **Enhanced tag display** - Show structured tags with visual hierarchy

**Technical Requirements**:
- Chronological sorting of workbook items
- URL routing: `/workbook` (latest), `/workbook/[slug]` (specific work)
- Integration with existing presentation mode
- Mobile-optimized touch navigation

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ `/workbook` loads latest work
- ✅ Prev/Next navigation through all works chronologically  
- ✅ Clean, focused presentation leveraging existing components
- ✅ Tags displayed (click behavior can be placeholder)
- ✅ Mobile-friendly navigation

**Deliverable**: 
```
/workbook → Latest work with chronological browsing
Click tags → Temporary redirect to existing workbook list (until Phase 2)
```

### 1.2 Navigation Enhancement
**Goal**: Polish navigation experience and presentation integration

**Features**:
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
- Date context in navigation
- Smooth transitions between works
- Integration with existing presentation mode
- Loading states and performance optimization

## Phase 2: Collections Foundation (2-3 sessions)

### 2.1 Collections Configuration System
**Goal**: Establish curated collections with friendly names

**Implementation**:
- **Collections config file** - YAML or frontmatter-based definitions
- **Query system** - Support single tags (`tech:video-synth`) and combinations
- **Metadata structure** - Names, descriptions, featured status

**Example Configuration**:
```yaml
collections:
  video-synthesis:
    name: "Video Synthesis"
    description: "Explorations in live video manipulation"
    query: "tech:video-synth"
    featured: true
    
  live-performance:
    name: "Live Performance"
    query: ["medium:performance"]
    featured: true
```

### 2.2 Dynamic Collection Generation
**Goal**: Build collection system from tag aggregation

**Technical Features**:
- Tag aggregation from workbook frontmatter
- Collection item filtering and counting
- URL structure: `/workbook/collections/video-synthesis`, `/workbook/collections/tech:video-synth`
- Related collection detection (shared tags)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Collections config system working
- ✅ `/workbook/collections/video-synthesis` → Collection landing
- ✅ Dynamic URLs functional: `/workbook/collections/tech:video-synth`
- ✅ Collection metadata (counts, descriptions) generated

**Deliverable**:
```
Collections config defined
/workbook/collections/video-synthesis → Collection landing
Dynamic URLs working but basic display
```

## Phase 3: Collection Grid & Integration (2-3 sessions)

### 3.1 Collection Grid View
**Goal**: Create beautiful grid layout with optimized thumbnails

**Components**:
- **`CollectionGrid.vue`** - Grid layout with Cloudflare Images variants
- **`CollectionHeader.vue`** - Collection name, description, metadata
- **`RelatedCollections.vue`** - Show tag intersections and suggestions

**Technical Features**:
- Cloudflare Images thumbnail variants (optimized for grid)
- Responsive grid layout (CSS Grid or Flexbox)
- Grid item hover effects and transitions
- Related collections based on tag overlap

### 3.2 Complete Integration
**Goal**: Seamless flow between folio and collection views

**Features**:
- **Folio ↔ Collection transitions** - Smooth navigation between views
- **Tag panel in folio** - Show which collections current work belongs to
- **Collection → folio navigation** - Click grid item → return to folio at that work
- **Keyboard navigation** - Arrow keys, escape routes, accessibility

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Image variant loading (thumbnail vs full resolution)
- Lazy loading for large collections
- Smooth transition animations
- Mobile gesture support

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Beautiful collection grid with optimized thumbnails
- ✅ Smooth transitions: folio → collection → folio
- ✅ Tag panel shows collection membership
- ✅ Keyboard navigation throughout
- ✅ Mobile-optimized experience

**Deliverable**:
```
Complete workbook experience:
/workbook → Chronological folio
Click tags → Collection grids  
Collection items → Back to folio
Smooth, fast, beautiful
```

## Phase 4: Polish & Enhancement (1-2 sessions)

### 4.1 Advanced Features
**Goal**: Add sophisticated discovery and exploration features

**Features**:
- **Search within collections** - Filter collection results by title/content
- **Related works suggestions** - "More like this" based on tag similarity
- **Collection intersections** - Show works that appear in multiple collections
- **Collection statistics** - Show collection growth over time

### 4.2 Performance & UX Polish
**Goal**: Production-ready performance and user experience

**Optimizations**:
- **Image variant optimization** - Perfect thumbnail sizes for different contexts
- **Loading states** - Smooth transitions and visual feedback
- **Error handling** - Graceful fallbacks for missing images/data
- **Analytics preparation** - Track popular collections and navigation patterns
- **SEO optimization** - Proper meta tags for collection pages
- **Accessibility audit** - Keyboard navigation, screen readers, ARIA labels

### 4.3 Future Extensibility
**Goal**: Prepare for future enhancements

**Architecture**:
- **Plugin system** for new collection types
- **Export functionality** for sharing collections
- **RSS feeds** for collections
- **Search indexing** preparation

## Success Metrics

### User Experience Goals
- **Fast browsing** - Smooth chronological navigation
- **Easy discovery** - Intuitive collection exploration  
- **Visual appeal** - Beautiful grid layouts and transitions
- **Mobile-first** - Excellent experience on all devices

### Technical Goals
- **Performance** - Fast loading with optimized images
