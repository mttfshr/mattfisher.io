### May 26, 2025 - Session 48 Summary
- **RESOLVED PIN THUMBNAILS ISSUE**:
  - **Root Cause Identified**: Pin processing system wasn't reading Cloudflare Images catalog despite 262+ thumbnails being uploaded
  - **Solution Implemented**: Modified `getPins.js` to integrate with `catalog.json` and use Cloudflare URLs for video pins
  - **Correct Priority Logic**: OpenGraph images first (creator-chosen), Cloudflare video thumbnails as fallback, component icons last
  - **Result**: All video pins now show proper thumbnails from Cloudflare Images when no OG image available
- **VITEPRESS UTILS REORGANIZATION INITIATED**:
  - **Analysis Completed**: Identified 16 files with functional duplication and unclear service boundaries
  - **Architecture Designed**: Microservices-inspired structure with services/, workflows/, shared/, maintenance/ directories
  - **Key Issues Found**: 3+ duplicate thumbnail processors, mixed concerns, unclear responsibilities
  - **Strategy Planned**: 4-phase implementation starting with core services consolidation
  - **Priority Shifted**: Workbook gallery development deferred to complete utils reorganization first
- **STRATEGIC DECISION**: 
  - Prioritizing code organization and technical debt reduction over new features
  - Foundation-first approach to ensure better maintainability and developer experience
  - Service-oriented architecture will enable faster future development
