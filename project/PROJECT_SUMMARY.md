# MattFisher.io Project Summary

## Project Path
`~/Github/mattfisher.io/`

## Context Continuity Instructions

**Instructions for Claude:**
1. **PRIORITY**: Read PROJECT_SUMMARY.md first - it now contains everything needed to start
2. **Quick Start**: Use "Current Task", "Available Utilities", and "Standard SOP" sections
3. **Avoid Redundant Reads**: Don't read session files, utilities, or design tokens separately
4. **Update this document within first 5 exchanges** and **when 75% through message limit**
5. **Alert Matt when approaching message limits (around 75% usage)**
6. **Memory-Efficient Focus**: Execute current task immediately using established patterns
7. **Keep responses execution-focused** rather than explanatory (details in PROJECT_SUMMARY)
8. **CRITICAL: AVOID DOCUMENTATION DUPLICATION** - Write session notes and planning info in central files only, not across multiple similar documents
9. **CONSOLIDATE DOCUMENTATION** - Update existing files rather than creating new ones unless absolutely necessary
10. **REFERENCE, DON'T REPEAT** - Point to existing documentation rather than duplicating content
11. Confirm understanding and proceed directly to current task

**Instructions for Matt:**
1. Share this document at the start of each new conversation
2. Ask Claude to update the "Current Task" section when nearing context limits  
3. **New**: This document now eliminates ~80% of startup file reads and prevents documentation bloat

## Standard Operating Procedure (Memory-Efficient & Anti-Duplication)

### **Documentation Rules - CRITICAL**
1. **UPDATE, DON'T CREATE** - Always update existing files rather than creating new documents
2. **REFERENCE, DON'T REPEAT** - Point to existing documentation instead of duplicating content
3. **CONSOLIDATE NOTES** - Write session notes in existing session files, not new documents
4. **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** - Each piece of information should exist in only one place
5. **LINK, DON'T COPY** - Use references to other documents rather than copying content

### For Any Component Conversion:
1. **Quick Analysis**: Check current vs backup line count
2. **CSS Focus**: Target 60-80% CSS reduction by removing redundant utilities
3. **Template Check**: Verify semantic class usage (usually already good)
4. **VitePress Preserve**: Keep `:deep()` overrides and component-specific styles
5. **Build Validate**: Ensure zero functionality regressions
6. **Document Impact**: Update session file with reduction metrics - **DO NOT CREATE NEW DOCS**

### Expected Results Every Time:
- **File Reduction**: 30-60% overall reduction
- **CSS Impact**: 60-80% CSS line reduction  
- **Functionality**: Zero breaking changes
- **Maintainability**: Dramatic improvement through global utility leverage
- **Documentation**: Updates to existing files only, no new document creation

### File Structure Map (Quick Reference)
- **Design Tokens**: `docs/.vitepress/theme/styles/design-tokens.css`
- **Layout Utilities**: `docs/.vitepress/theme/styles/utilities/layout.css`
- **Component Patterns**: `docs/.vitepress/theme/styles/components.css`
- **Advanced Patterns**: `docs/.vitepress/theme/styles/patterns.css`
- **Global Utilities**: `docs/.vitepress/theme/styles/utilities.css`

## Documentation Consolidation Rules

### **Central Documentation Files (ONLY UPDATE THESE)**
- **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** - Primary status and continuity (this file)
- **PROJECT_PLAN.md** - High-level roadmap and phases
- **DESIGN_SYSTEM_COMPLETE.md** - Technical design system details
- **Session files** - Individual session logs in chronological order

### **PROHIBITED Documentation Practices**
- ❌ **Creating new summary documents** - Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md instead
- ❌ **Creating new completion documents** - Update existing completion docs
- ❌ **Duplicating session notes** - Write once in session files only
- ❌ **Copying technical details** - Reference existing technical docs
- ❌ **Creating redundant guides** - Update existing guides

### **REQUIRED Documentation Practices**
- ✅ **Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** - For status changes and new information
- ✅ **Reference existing docs** - Link to rather than duplicate content
- ✅ **Single session logs** - One file per session with all notes
- ✅ **Append to existing files** - Add to current docs rather than create new ones
- ✅ **Cross-reference clearly** - Use links between related documents
